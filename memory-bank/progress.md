## Current Status
- Phase 1 (Project Setup) is complete
- Phase 2 (Core Implementation) is complete: FastAPI, endpoints, LLM integration, and database connections are working
- Phase 3 (Integration) is in progress:
  - Completed: Article ingestion, Vector store, Neo4j integration
  - Planned improvements for Vector store:
    - Title-based chunking for better document structure
    - Reference handling for cleaner content
    - Enhanced text cleaning
    - HNSW space configuration for better search
- Phase 4 (Security & Hooks) is in progress
- Basic project structure is in place
- Development environment is configured

## Known Issues
- None at this stage

## Next Milestones
1. Implement vector store improvements
2. Complete security implementations
3. Set up agent routing system
4. Implement Strapi lifecycle hooks
5. Complete testing suite
6. Deploy to production
